# HATEOAS-Appeals-agupt103-Eclipse
Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) to implement business function

This project is a Java web application which uses HATEOS to implement business functions. I implemented grade appeal system where students can appeal for their grades and the professor can have a look at their appeals and act accordingly.
Students can appeal for their grades to be reviewed, can leave comments on their grades, can ask for exam copies to be rechecked and professor can read their appeals and can accept or deny their appeals.
I designed a server and client application for the interaction between the front end and backend database.
Database used was XML.
